%% Position control
% We should now have the most basic controllers already in place: we have a 
% Vertical Stabilization System, a PFC Current controller, and a plasma current 
% controller. We shall now address the problem of *plasma position control*.
%% Preliminaries: the RZIp model
% As for the other exercises, here we will use our CREATE-NL plasma equilibrium 
% and CREATE-L linearized model to design our controllers. However, remember that 
% these models are obtained through a custom FEM code and a carefully designed 
% linearization procedure. Having such a tool is very useful, but it was not at 
% all common in the early days of plasma control, and in this way we are somehow 
% cheating, hiding the dust of complexity under the rug. For this reason, it is 
% instructive to take a step back and turn our attention to a slightly simpler 
% model: the so-called *RZIp model.*
% 
% RZIp simply stands for R(radial) + Z(vertical) + Ip(plasma current), and it 
% is a "simple" model used to describe the plasma (rigid) vertical and radial 
% motion plus the variations in the plasma current. Different variations on such 
% a model exist, we'll take a look at one possible formulation. Along the way, 
% we will examine the basic aspects of _*toroidal force balance*_ in tokamaks 
% and provide an expression for the $B_V$ field seen in the VS exercise (we'll 
% mostly stick to a *qualitative picture* and provide an overview of some classic 
% results).
% Radial force balance
% We have already seen that:
%% 
% # elongated plasma configurations are vertically unstable, calling for an 
% active stabilization system
% # plasma current need to be regulated, in order to counteract resistive drop 
% and noninductive current sources
%% 
% These issues arise even in the most crude plasma models, e.g. if we consider 
% the plasma as a rigid filament carrying a current. However, tokamaks are much 
% more complex than this. The basic recipe for a tokamak is based on the so-called 
% _screw pinch,_ i.e. a plasma cylinder with an helical current/field pattern; 
% the parents of the screw-pinch are the _Z-pinch_ (roughly: good confinement 
% properties) and the $\theta$_-pinch_ (roughly: good stability properties), two 
% early cylindrical plasma confinement configurations. The main drawback of cylindrical 
% devices is that they loose plasma at the ends: so, the scientists of the early 
% days of fusion research had the idea to bend them into _doughnut-shaped_ machines: 
% tokamaks, RFPs, stellarators are all consequences of this first idea.
% 
% However, when we bend the plasma, suddenly we are faced with a deformable 
% ring of ionized gas at 100 million degrees. In particular, with respect to a 
% current-carrying wire, plasma can _change shape,_ and the first consequence 
% is that it is *subject to _radial forces*_, as well as to vertical ones.
% 
% In particular, the three main radial forces that awaken when we bend the plasma 
% (I'll shorten it to BTP速 and put a trademark symbol here :) ) are:
%% 
% # the *tire-tube* force
% # the *hoop* force
% # the *1/R* force
% Tire-tube force
% The LCFS can be seen as an isobaric line. However, BTP速 makes the external 
% surface larger, and since force is pressure times surface, as a result we have 
% a *net outward force*.
% 
% Note that this effect arises in both Z-pinches and $\theta$-pinches when we 
% BTP速, as it depends on pressure.
% 
% 
% Hoop force
% We all know that a closed loop carrying a current suffers some *E+M stresses* 
% which tend to tear it apart. Usually, a wire is made of some solid conducting 
% material (aka metal), so that's not a big deal. However, things are different 
% with plasma.
% 
% At a closer inspection, it turns out that the field is _stronger_ in the inside 
% of the doughnut (it's not a case that it is called the "*high field side*" of 
% the tokamak...). B lines are packed more closely on the inside than on the outside, 
% and the result is -again- a *net outward force*. 
% 
% This effect arises when we bend Z-pinches: the toroidal current is responsible 
% of this effect.
% 
% 
% 
% 
% 1/R force
% Finally, BTP速 results in the fact that the toroidal field has an inverse dependence 
% on the radius (as in the well-known formula for the field inside a toroidal 
% solenoid). Remember that the current flows helically on the flux surfaces, so 
% current also has a poloidal component, whose interaction with the field results 
% -_again!_- in a *net outward force*.
% 
% This effect arises in $\theta$-pinches: this time, it is the poloidal current 
% which is to blame (just to get the idea, imagine an approximately constant surface 
% current density which interacts with a different toroidal field).
% 
% 
% 
% 
% Restoring force
% We have two ways of counteracting these effects
%% 
% # surrounding the plasma with a (perfectly) *conducting wall*
% # adding a *vertical magnetic field*
%% 
% In the first case, the wall "traps" the field lines, which get compressed 
% as the plasma moves outward. The increased value of the magnetic field results 
% in a *restoring magnetic pressure*
% 
% 
% 
% However, as we have already seen *perfect walls do not exist!* The walls are 
% always *resistive*, and eventually the flux diffuses across the wall. We cannot 
% trap a plasma indefinitely in this way (without taking into account the fact 
% that a perfectly conducting wall would be a pain in the neck during breakdown 
% - see what happened at WEST a few years ago...)
% 
% In the second case, we can carefully choose the magnitude of the *applied 
% field* in order to balance the net outward force
% 
% 
% 
% This field is the $B_V$ that we saw when talking about the VS system!
% 
% Without digging into messy calculations, we just mention that, at least *for 
% a circular, high aspect ratio plasma*, the resulting forces can be calculated 
% as
%% 
% * *Tire-tube*: $F_1 = \frac{\mu_0 I_p^2}{4} \beta_p$                             
% notice how this force depends on _pressure_ through $\beta_p := \frac{<p>_{V_p}}{\frac{B^2_p(a)}{2\mu_0}} 
% = \frac{4 \int_{V_p} p dV}{\mu_0 R_0 I_p^2}$;
% * *Hoop*:      $F_2 = \frac{1}{2}\mu_0 I_p^2 \left[\ln \frac{8 R_0}{a} -1 
% + \frac{l_i}{2}\right]$     notice how this force depends on the (_toroidal)_ 
% _current distribution through $l_i := \frac{<B_p^2>_{V_p}}{B_p^2(a)} = \frac{4 
% \int_{V_p} \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0} dV}{\mu_0 R_0 I_p^2}$;
% * *1/R*:          $F_3 = 2 \pi^2 a^2 \left[ \frac{B^2_\phi (a)}{2\mu_0} - 
% \frac{<B_\phi^2>}{2\mu_0}  \right]$  notice how this force depends on the _toroidal 
% field $B_\phi$. 
%% 
% It can be shown that the 1/R force can also be rewritten as
% 
% $$F_3 = \frac{\mu_0}{4}I_p^2 (\beta_p - 1)$$ 
% 
% and hence the net resulting force is 
% 
% $$F_R = F_1 + F_2 + F_3 = \frac{\mu_0}{2} I_p^2 \left[ \ln \frac{8 R_0}{a} 
% + \beta_p + \frac{l_i}{2} -\frac{3}{2}  \right]$$
% 
% We need to apply a force equal and opposite through an appropriate choice 
% of the vertical field:
% 
% $$F_V = -I_p B_V 2 \pi R_0 \hat{r}$$ 
% 
% (directed along the negative radial direction) and hence
% 
% $$B_V = \frac{\mu_0 I_p}{4 \pi R_0} \left[  \ln \frac{8 R_0}{a} + \beta_p 
% + \frac{l_i}{2}  -\frac{3}{2}   \right]$$
%% The RZIp model
% We are now ready to present the equations forming the RZIp model. RZIp is 
% a LTI model used to describe plasma-vessel coupled dynamics. The main assumption 
% is that *the plasma current distribution remains constant* during any control 
% action, while *the centroid can move* both vertically and radially and *the 
% plasma current* (i.e. the integral of the current density) *can change* over 
% time.
% 
% The model takes into account the currents in the active circuits, the passive 
% structures (usually through a filamentary model) and the total plasma current. 
% Often, *the plasma is represented by a set of filamentary currents* (but simpler 
% versions of this model may use a single filament of variable radius). The RZIp 
% equations are:
% 
% $$L_a \dot{I}_a + R_a I_a + M_{ae} \dot{I}_e + \dot{\psi}_{ap} = V_a \\L_e 
% \dot{I}_e + R_e I_e + M_{ea} \dot{I}_a + \dot{\psi}_{ep} = 0 \\m_p \ddot{z}_p 
% = - 2 \pi r_p I_P \bar{B}_r(r_p,z_p,I_a,I_e,I_p) \\m_p \ddot{r}_p = + 2 \pi 
% r_p I_P \bar{B}_z(r_p,z_p,I_a,I_e,I_p) + F_r(r_p,I_p,\beta_p,l_i) \\\frac{d}{dt} 
% \left[  L_p I_p \right] + R_p I_p + \dot{\psi}_{pa} + \dot{\psi}_{pe} = 0$$
% 
% where
%% 
% * $M_{ae}, M_{ea}$ and $R_{a,e}$ are the matrices containing *self and mutual 
% inductances* of the conducting elements (coil and passive structures) and their 
% *resistances*
% * $\psi_{ap}, \psi_{ep}$ represent the *flux due to the plasma current distribution* 
% enclosed by the active and passive circuits respectively. A generic element 
% of these vectors can be written as $\psi_{(ae)p,k} = M_{(ae)kp} I_p = \int_{plasma} 
% \tilde{M}_{(ae)kJ}(r,z)J(r,z) dr dz$, $k$ is the index of the considered circuit, 
% $J$ is the current density distribution obtained from a reference equilibrium 
% and $\tilde{M}_{(ae)kJ}$ is the mutual inductance between the $k$-th active/passive 
% circuit and the points on the poloidal plane where the current density is evaluated.
% * $\psi_{p(ae)}$ contain the *flux due to the surrounding circuits* enclosed 
% by the plasma, which can be written as $\psi_{p(ae)}=\sum_k M_{p(ae)k} I_{(ae)k}$, 
% again with $k$ index of the considered active/passive circuit. Notice that these 
% terms depend both on the active/passive currents and the plasma filaments position!
% * $(\bar{B}_r,\bar{B}_z)$ are the *components of the magnetic field generated 
% by the external conductors* and acting on the plasma, computed as a weighted 
% average of the Lorentz force due to the poloidal magnetic field $(B_r, B_z)$ 
% generated by the external conductors and acting on the toroidal plasma current 
% distribution
% * $F_r$ is the *net radial outward force* deriving from plasma pressure and 
% tokamak toroidal geometry, which (as we have seen) is a function of $\beta_p$ 
% and $l_i$, of the total plasma current $I_p$ and of the plasma radial position 
% $r_p$.
%% 
% As you can see, with respect to the filamentary model seen in the VS exercise, 
% here we kept the equations describing the dynamics of the active and passive 
% currents, but *we allowed the plasma current to change* and we added the *radial 
% force balance equation*. Moreover, often in RZIp models, *more than a single 
% plasma filament is used*, each filament carrying a current that is related to 
% the internal plasma current profile.
% 
% Again, in most cases the plasma is assumed to be _massless_, i.e. $m_p \rightarrow 
% 0$. This can be formally seen as a the application of the _singular perturbation_ 
% method: we substitute equations (2) and (3) in the model above with static relations 
% that need to be satisfied.
% 
% 
% 
% After this short overview, we are ready to design our controller.
%% RZIp control using a CREATE-L model
% Let's see how we can design a RZIp controller with our CREATE-L/NL model. 
% RZIp controllers are often used in the *early phases* of a discharge, when the 
% plasma is still *limiter* and shape control is not active yet. We have already 
% designed an $I_p$ controller, and we know that (if we have done everything the 
% right way) it should be decoupled from the plasma position/shape dynamics. So, 
% what we actually need to do is to design the controllers for $r_p$ and $z_p$.
% 
% Also notice that, usually, vertical stabilization is in charge of _stopping_ 
% the vertical motion of the plasma, i.e. bringing the vertical velocity to zero. 
% On the other hand, *RZIp controls the _position_ of the plasma*, regulating 
% it to a desided value (usually on slower time scales). This choice is made so 
% that the two controllers do not interact (in a bad sense).
% 
% For simplicity, we'll keep working with our SOF model of JT-60SA. We start 
% by loading our model and extracting the quantities of interest

addpath ./functions
addpath ./models

% the plant into two SISO systems. To do so, we may choose current combinations
